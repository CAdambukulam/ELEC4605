Prior to loading the buffer, we must empty it, so that the previous pulse sequence does affect the one we wish to program. We can do this by calling the 'reset_channel_buffer' method of the 'PulseBlasterESRPRO' class. We may then construct the pulse sequence. Simply put, a pulse sequence is composed of an array of 'pulse' objects which have a level (either 0 or 1 - corresponging to 0V or 3.3V at the PulseBlaster output) and a duration. Once this array is defined it can be loaded into the pulse sequence buffer of the corresponding channel via the channel's 'pulse_sequence_buffer.set()' method."

    "1. Initialisation pulse of 500μs length. \n",
    "2. A first Readout pulse of 500μs length after a time delay τ.\n",
    "3. A second Readout pulse of same length that is 180◦ away from the first readout pulse.\n",
    "\n",
    "The delay τ can then be swept from 100μs to 10 ms to obtain a T1 signature exponential decay signal. Ideally we would only require one initialisation and one readout pulse. However, since our laser is also effectively modulated at the same frequency as the envelope, it would drown out the weak T1 signal. Think about what signal component the lock-in apmplifier measures from the spin signal and from the photoluminescence signal. This experiment requires a very low reference frequency ('ref_f' = 21 Hz). This is because the pulses separated by the delay τ must be able to fit within the envelope period, and the idle time after the pulses needs to be much longer than T1."
